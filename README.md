# Code Samples from "Modular Programming with Python" #

This repository contains all the various code samples from my book "Modular
Programming with Python", published by Packt Publishing.

The code samples are organized by chapter.  Feel free to copy and use these in
whatever way you like -- there are no restrictions at all on the use of these
code samples.
